If you don't do this, the app can't start. Then, you must install the daemon to make the app works properly.\r\nYou only have to insert your admin password.\r\n\r\n## The daemon\r\nEvery time you plug an USB device, the daemon will activate and check it. If it found some new NTFS devices, it add them to the fstab file.\r\nFrom that moment, you won't see the NTFS devices on your desktop. You have to open the Volumes folder or create a link to it. You can use the app to do this.\r\nIf you'll remove the app from Applications folder without uninstalling the daemon, it will self-delete (when you plug an USB device), removing all the lines written on fstab and making visible to you all the devices associated.\r\n\r\n## Copying files\r\nTo copy files you have to open the app, having an NTFS device plugged in and the daemon installed.\r\nJust drag and drop all the files to copy in the app's drop area. Then, press copy.\r\nIt will alert if there are some files/folders with the same name on the device.\r\n\r\n## Why using the app and not the Finder?\r\nIf you use the Finder to copy files (with the daemon installed), it will copy all of them on the device. And it seems to be ok, until you plug off the device.\r\nThe next time you plug it in, you'll see the files copied, but you will not able to open/copy/move them. Why? Because the Finder \"forgets\" to release them.\r\nSo, the OS will think that these files are in use, and it won't allow you to use them.\r\nUsing the app instead of the Finder will ensure you to correctly copy the files.\r\n\r\n# How to build\r\nTo build this program make sure you installed all the **Qt** libraries.\r\nAlso be sure to export the _**qmake path**_ in this way:\r\n\r\n```script\r\n$ PATH=/users/<your_user>/Qt/<qt_version>/bin:$PATH\r\n$ export PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst of all, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Mani-GS/NTFS_writer/releases/latest), then extract the source code in one folder. Open a terminal in that folder and execute:\r\n\r\n```script\r\n$ qmake -config release\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen right-click the app, select \"Show package contents\" and copy the \"script\" folder inside \"Contents\".\r\nOn a terminal, execute this:\r\n\r\n```script\r\n$ chmod 755 NTFS_Writer.app\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to run it on another MAC (a MAC without Qt libraries), you have to execute this:\r\n\r\n```script\r\n$ macdeployqt ./NTFS_Writer.app\r\n```\r\n\r\nDouble click the APP file, named **NTFS_Writer**, and the program will start!",
